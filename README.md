# Random-forest-model-for-50-startup-dataset-
# Predicting Startup Profit using Random Forest

## Overview
This project applies **Random Forest Regression** to predict startup profits based on various features such as R&D Spend, Administration, Marketing Spend, and State. The dataset used is `50_Startups.csv`, which contains information about 50 startups, including their expenses and profit margins.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **R&D Spend**: Amount spent on research and development.
- **Administration**: Expenses related to administration.
- **Marketing Spend**: Budget allocated for marketing.
- **State**: The state where the startup operates (categorical feature).
- **Profit**: The target variable representing the company's profit.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.
   - Separate features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
   - Apply **One-Hot Encoding** to convert the categorical feature (`State`) into numerical form.
   
2. **Model Training**
   - Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.
   - Train a **Random Forest Regressor** model with `100` estimators.
   
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Predict on the test set.
   - Compute evaluation metrics:
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **R-squared Score (RÂ²)**
     - **Testing Score (RÂ² on test set)**
   
## Installation & Dependencies
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/startup-profit-prediction.git
cd startup-profit-prediction
```

2. Update the `file_path` variable in the script to the correct location of `50_Startups.csv`.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

## Output Example
```
The features are:
   R&D Spend  Administration  Marketing Spend       State
0    165349.2       136897.8        471784.1   New York
1    162597.7       151377.6        443898.5  California

Random Forest with 100 estimators:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 3963.25
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 27384906.54
R-squared Score (RÂ²): 0.92
Testing Score (RÂ² on Test Set): 0.91
```

## Future Improvements
- Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Experiment with other regression models (e.g., XGBoost, Linear Regression).
- Visualize feature importance using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.
